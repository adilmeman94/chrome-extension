# chrome-extension

I created chrome extension with following release

Release 1
Create a basic extension and launch it locally in your browser. The extension should ask for your name as an input and then display 'Hello <name>' on the web page

Release 2
Write the method to get access to the 'new tab' page and displays something every time you open a new tab

Release 3
Integrate any API of your choice which you will ping for content to display on the new tab page. E.g. Display top trending GIF on the new tab, the top post on Reddit, One link from your Pocket account, The weather of the location you're currently in, etc
